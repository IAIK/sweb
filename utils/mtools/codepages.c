#include "codepage.h"

/* MS-DOS doesn't use the same ASCII code as Unix does. The appearance
 * of the characters is defined using code pages. These code pages
 * aren't the same for all countries. For instance, some code pages
 * don't contain upper case accented characters. This affects two
 * things, relating to filenames:

 * 1. upper case characters. In short names, only upper case
 * characters are allowed.  This also holds for accented characters.
 * For instance, in a code page which doesn't contain accented
 * uppercase characters, the accented lowercase characters get
 * transformed into their unaccented counterparts. This is very bad
 * design. Indeed, stuff like national language support should never
 * affect filesystem integrity. And it does: A filename which is legal
 * in one country could be illegal in another one. Bad News for
 * frequent travellers.

 * 2. long file names: Micro$oft has finally come to their senses and
 * uses a more standard mapping for the long file names.  They use
 * Unicode, which is basically a 32 bit version of ASCII. Its first
 * 256 characters are identical to Unix ASCII. Thus, the code page
 * also affects the correspondence between the codes used in long
 * names and those used in short names.

 * Such a bad design is rather unbelievable. That's why I quoted the
 * translation tables. BEGIN FAIR USE EXCERPT:
